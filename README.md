# Salon Website

Welcome to our salon website project! This README file contains important information about the project setup, contributors, and security considerations.

## Project Description

This project is a website for our salon, showcasing our services, allowing users to create accounts, book appointments and more. It aims to provide users with information about our salon and attract potential clients.

## Security Considerations

In the perpetual battle between attackers and security specialists, we take our place in discovering the “SQL injection” attack, which manipulates the SQL query via the user’s inputs to disclose sensitive data from the database.

### Access Borders

The website consists of different pages with various access borders:

- **Home Page**: Can be accessed by anyone and contains general information about the salon.
- **Customer Pages**: Can be accessed only by a customer who has already signed up for the website. They can perform different functionalities related only to their appointments.
- **Admin Access**: Accessible via a specific account (username = “admin” & password = “admin123”) to apply changes to the salon’s services and the customer’s appointments.
